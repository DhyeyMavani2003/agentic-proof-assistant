# Agentic Proof Assistant

In Progress.

## Project Setup:

### 1. Custom Python Virtual Environment Setup:
- Install Python 3.9 or higher.
- Create a new Python virtual environment using `python3 -m venv .venv`
- Activate the new Python virtual environment using `source .venv/bin/activate`
- To check the location & version of Python, one can use the commands `which python` & `python --version` respectively
- To check which dependencies are currently present, one can use `pip list` (if this throws an error, consider installing `pip` package-management software)
- Once you are done actively using the environment, one can free up the RAM using `deactivate` command.
